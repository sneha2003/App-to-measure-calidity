# App-to-measure-calidity
Eventhough there are many devices available to measure the calidity, people are able to use it only to a certain limit within a particular boundary. Also, there is no proper visualization provided. Visualization help people save time. People in distant places cannot monitor calidity using these conventional devices.
This model measures the calidity for which an app is designed for the user to monitor from distant places. It is interfaced with firebase cloud to instantly update the client regarding the calidity measured.
